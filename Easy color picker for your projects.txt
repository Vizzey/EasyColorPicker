Easy color picker for your projects. Just install it and all your hex/rgb colors will be recognized as colors.
A tiny color picker for Visual Studio 2022 that detects color literals in your code and lets you edit them in place.

### What it recognizes:

**#abc, #aabbcc, #aabbccdd in any case**

**rgb(r, g, b) / rgba(r, g, b, a) in any case**

**WinAPI macro RGB(r, g, b) (C/C++)**



# How to use

1. Open a file that contains any of the literals above (or write, for example #000).
2. A small color square appears right before each color. Click the square.
3. In the picker window:

- Left panel: big gradient square to pick saturation/brightness.
- Narrow vertical bar: hue selector.
- Right panel: R, G, B sliders and an A (alpha) slider.
- “Transparent Channel” checkbox toggles alpha on/off.


### Live editing

As you drag or move sliders, the color in your code is updated immediately.
The original function name and casing are preserved:

- rgb ↔ rgba (lowercase stays lowercase)
- RGB ↔ RGBA (uppercase stays uppercase)
- Checking “Transparent Channel” converts rgb→rgba and RGB→RGBA.
- Unchecking converts back to rgb/RGB.
- For hex (#RRGGBB), turning on transparency writes rgba(...).
- <#AARRGGBB> is treated as rgba(...).


### Alpha rules

- A slider is shown only when “Transparent Channel” is on.
- Alpha is written as 0–1 with two decimals (e.g., 0.25, 1).



### Window behavior

- Opens near your cursor.
- Closes when it loses focus (click outside). Reopen by clicking the square again.



### Tips

- If you don’t see the square, ensure the text literally matches one of the supported formats.
- For C/C++ WinAPI, start with RGB(...). Turning on transparency will switch to RGBA(...) automatically.
